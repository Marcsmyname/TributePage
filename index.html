        <h2> Are You Sitting Comfortably, Then I shall Begin by <i>By Tomer Strolight</i></h2>

        <p>
            Just before I read this story, and I know there's a lot of listeners.

            It's a quite extraordinary story and I want to say it's a true story.
            
            Doesn't this isn't like a Marvel comic story where it's made up characters doing made up things.
            
            This is actually a real-life story and it's quite extraordinary.
            
            Which is why I have to point it out because so many of the things.
            
            And this story might see.
            
            Unbelievable, but it's true.
            
            So I just wanted to really stress that before we go in and the story I'm going to just start reading right away.
            
            But the story is called Satoshi Nakamoto and his Bitcoin invention.
            
            And I'll begin.
            
            Once Upon a time, there was a man.
            
            Maybe it was a woman.
            
            Or maybe it was a group of people.
            
            Maybe it was a time traveling alien, artificial intelligence spider robot.
            
            We don't know because they never revealed who they really were.
            
            We'll just say he was a he because that's what he said he was.
            
            But it was really a secret identity the whole time.
            
            Nobody knew who he really was.
            
            He called himself Satoshi Nakamoto.
            
            We know that he really existed.
            
            He appeared on the Internet in 2008 to say he had invented a new form of money.
            
            Nobody had asked him to do this.
            
            But he thought we needed a new form of money, so he invented one.
            
            He called it Bitcoin.
            
            There have been many inventors and inventions throughout history.
            
            Many thousands of years ago someone invented the wheel.
            
            Since then, nobody has invented anything better for moving things around on land.
            
            We also don't know who the inventor of the wheel was.
            
            Inventors have to use things they find around them and do something entirely new with them.
            
            That's what it means to invent something.
            
            To invent the first wheel, its inventor probably needed a big Flat Rock and some tool to chip away at it to make it round.
            
            To invent Bitcoin, Satoshi had to use something other than rocks and chisels.
            
            He wanted everyone in the world to use his invention, so he used the Internet.
            
            He wanted nobody to be in charge of it, so he used a special type of computer program called peer to peer.
            
            He wanted it to be fair so that nobody could steal it or make any of it without working hard for it.
            
            So he is the special type of math called cryptography.
            
            It was very hard to invent Bitcoin.
            
            People had tried for a long time to invent Internet money that could not be stolen.
            
            He figured out how to do it.
            
            And he did it.
            
            And he released it into the world.
            
            People saw Satoshi invention.
            
            Why do we need a new money?
            
            Some asked, not really looking for an answer.
            
            It will never work, said others, many others just ignored it.
            
            But some people looked at it and saw goodness.
            
            This could solve them.
            
            The world.
            
            These people began to use Bitcoin.
            
            They ran it.
            
            They improved it.
            
            They told other people about it.
            
            Bitcoin began to spread.
            
            More people heard about it and they told others and so it spread even more.
            
            It worked.
            
            It couldn't be stopped.
            
            The world best hackers couldn't stop it.
            
            The world's mightiest armies couldn't stop it.
            
            Even the people who hated Bitcoin couldn't stop it.
            
            Bitcoin had only one weakness.
            
            What was bitcoins weakness?
            
            What if someone found out who Satoshi really was?
            
            Could they force him to do something to Bitcoin that would make it stop?
            
            Could they make him make Bitcoin weaker?
            
            Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin, was it's only weakness.
            
            He knew what he had to do.
            
            He had prepared for it.
            
            He did it.
            
            He disappeared.
            
            Whoever Satoshi was or whatever Satoshi was.
            
            The secret identity stopped being used.
            
            It went silent.
            
            After that.
            
            Truly, nobody was in charge of Bitcoin.
            
            Everybody could use it.
            
            Everybody could count on it.
            
            Nobody could stop it.
            
            When Satoshi gave up the power to control Bitcoin, that single deed made sure that nobody would ever have so much power again.
            
            Bitcoin now had no weakness.
            
            And people saw that.
            
            And they liked it.
            
            Bitcoin began to grow faster than ever before.
            
            It gave hope to millions and billions of people.
            
            It ended in justices.
            
            It let people safely keep the money that they had worked hard for.
            
            It made sure.
            
            No one could steal someone else is money.
            
            It taught people about being responsible and honest.
            
            It was money for every single person in the world.
            
            Satoshi was a special type of hero.
            
            He was a.
            
            Hero who gave the world a gift.
            
            He made something that was very hard to make.
            
            He didn't ask for anything in return.
            
            He didn't ask.
            
            To be paid.
            
            He didn't ask to be famous.
            
            He didn't ask to be powerful.
            
            He just gave the world his gift.
            
            And walked away.
            
            Because of Bitcoin, many new things were possible.
            
            New inventions could be built using Bitcoin, just like with the wheel.
            
            After the wheel was invented, many new things were possible.
            
            Somebody could invent the car, so somebody did.
            
            Even airplanes need wheels for takeoff and landing.
            
            There are so many inventions that have wheels in them.
            
            What amazing new inventions will Bitcoin make possible?
            
            Maybe someday you two will be an inventor who uses Bitcoin in your invention.
            
            You can be thanks to Satoshi and all the people who made Bitcoin possible.
            
            The end.
